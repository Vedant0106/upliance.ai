# React Form Builder Assignment

This is my React form builder project, designed and developed entirely by me. I built it from the ground up to create dynamic, customizable forms with a clean and intuitive interface.

## About This Project

I developed this app to solve the need for easily creating and managing forms with various field types and validation rules. The project features:

- Drag and drop field reordering
- Dynamic field validation
- Custom field types like text, select, radio, checkbox, and more
- Clean and responsive UI for a smooth user experience

Everything you see here is built by me with React and modern frontend best practices.

## How to Run

- Clone this repo
- Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn`
- Start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`
